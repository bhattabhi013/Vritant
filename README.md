## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Successful communication requires the efforts of all people involved
in a conversation. Even when the person with hearing loss utilize
hearing aids and active listening strategies, it is crucial that others
involved in the communication process consistently use good
communication strategies.
The solution is to provide access to persons with hearing impairment
audio information received over a variety of sources and enable
persons with hearing disability communicate with fellow humans.

- The main barrier to communication for people who are hearing
impaired is the lack of consideration by others.
- There is an urgent requirement to include all humans into the
society as per the ratification of the UNCRPD act.
- Considering the wealth of information that is being circulated, the
persons with hearing impairment may lag behind if they are unable
to access this information, some of which may be vital and urgent.

## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>
We are trying to create an application/web-based solution following its
incorporated features: 
- Active voice to text captioning with an additional live video feed
captioning via the camera of the phone.
- Caption embedded video or the transcription file for the uploaded
video which can be downloaded and made offline.
- At last, the inculcation of Real-Time Text over a voice call so that the
person with hearing impairment can fluently talk to the other person
over call, in an attempt to diminish the communication gap.

These features would allow users with hearing impairment to
communicate with the outer world more effectively as they would
constructively understand the vital information shared with little to no
barriers, making the environment more inclusive.

## 🚀 Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>
- Generating soothing
music which could be
felt using low frequency
vibrations and waves.
- Speech-reading to aid
communication within a
group.
- Vibrations synced with
braille script for
effective communication
with visual and haptic
aid.
