## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

- Successful communication requires the efforts of all people involved
The education industry is being digitized through smart devices and technology is addictive and fascinating. 
- Reading books is really boring but with the help of AR, we can help turn it into a fun experience.

## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>
We are trying to create an application/web-based solution following its
incorporated features: 
- Vritaant is a cross-platform application to help the naughty and carefree young ones learn and understand nursery rhymes in a fun and interactive way.
- Vritaant helps to incorporate Augmented Reality  based digital learning experiences to help children take their first step into formal education
- Visualisation of nursery rhymes by putting them in a real 3D environment with in-space
navigation support.
- 3D models for the rhyme characters are  supporting and connecting blocks to create a setting and putting it in the real world.
- Augmented Reality powered voice-based support aims at helping kids aged 3-4 to learn nursery rhymes at a faster pace.
- Support for playground features makes it easier to test out various 3D models that are accessible, perform various transformations, and render numerous instances.
- The application is made more secure by leveraging Google authentication through Firebase.

- Now clone the forked repository by running this command in the terminal:
  - ```
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Vritant.git
    ``` 
- Either create an Android emulator or connect a physical device to run the project.
- Now get to the root of your Flutter project using :
  - ```
    cd <name of your root>
    ```
- Run this command from the root of your Flutter project or simply press Ctrl + F5:

      git commit -m "Add your title here"
      ```
- Push your changes using the command git push:
  -   ```
      git push -u origin your-branch-name

## 💻 How to run the project on local system? <a name = "local_system"></a>

- To run Flutter App on a Physical Device & Online Emulator(Android/Ios) :
### Online Emulator [Android OS | Android Studio/Vs Code ]

1. On Android Studio -> Tools > AVD Manager and click  "Create Virtual Device".

2. Choose any device model  and click on "Next".

3.  List of Recommended files, API, SDK, tools to download will be Listed now  again click on "Next".

4.  After that  give name to your emulator and finally click on "Finish".

5. After configuration, you will see the list of emulators just click on the "Play" button to run an emulator. 

6. You much have a running emulator to run your application.

### Online Emulator [MAC/Ios OS | X- Code/Vs Code ]

1. On your Mac, find the Simulator via Spotlight or by using the following command:

       $ open -a Simulator
      
2. Make sure your simulator is using a 64-bit device (iPhone 5s or later). You can check the device by viewing the settings in the simulator’s Hardware > Device or File > Open Simulator menus.

3. Depending on your development machine’s screen size, simulated high-screen-density iOS devices might overflow your screen. Grab the corner of the simulator and drag it to change the scale. You can also use the Window > Physical Size or Window > Pixel Accurate options if your computer’s resolution is high enough.

4. Create a new Flutter app:

       $ flutter create my_app

5. A my_app directory is created  containing Flutter’s starter app. Enter this directory:

         $ cd my_app

6. To launch the app in the Simulator, ensure that the Simulator is running and enter:

         $  flutter run





### Physical  Devices [Android OS] 

1. Go to Settings -> Developer Options [Default: Not Activated] 

2. Go to About Phone -> Software Information -> Build Number   and click multiple Times on it to enable Developer Option 

3. Go to the Developer Options -> Turn it On and  scroll and turn the "USB Debugging" On and Allow the Debugging

4. Connect your Mobile Device and Computer with a USB

5. Click ok to the Prompt "Allow USB Debugging on this Computer"

6. Go to the Terminal and run "Flutter Doctor " to make sure everything is located well 

7. Go to the IDE and Choose your Real Device name on the Dropdown menu of Device Section and hit Run 

8. Enjoy a Fast Excecution with USB Debugging and launch your app on your Real Device.

### Physical  Devices [ IOS] 

- To deploy  Flutter app to a physical iPhone/iPad first set up physical device deployment in Xcode and an Apple Developer account. 
- If your app is using Flutter plugins, you will also need the third-party CocoaPods dependency manager.

- The first time you use an attached physical device for iOS development, you need to trust both your Mac and the Development Certificate on that device. 
- On iOS 16 and higher you must also enable Developer Mode.

- Select Trust in the dialog prompt when first connecting the iOS device to your Mac.

-  Go to  Settings ->  General > Device Management and trust your Certificate. 
- For first time usersGeneral > Profiles > Device Management instead.
-  On iOS 16 and higher, navigate back to the top level of the Settings app, select Privacy & Security > Developer Mode, and toggle Developer Mode on.

- Follow the Xcode signing flow to provision your project:

- Open the default Xcode workspace in project by running open ios/Runner.xcworkspace in a terminal  from your  project directory.

- Select the device you intend to deploy to in the device drop-down menu next  the run .

- Select the Runner project in the left navigation panel.

- In the Runner target settings page, make sure your Development Team is selected under Signing & Capabilities > Team.

- When you select a team, Xcode creates and downloads a Development Certificate, registers your device with your account, and creates and downloads a provisioning profile (if needed).

- To start your first iOS development project  sign into Xcode with your Apple ID.

- For details about membership types, see Choosing a Membership.

- If automatic signing fails in Xcode, verify that the project’s General > Identity > Bundle Identifier value is unique.

- Start your app by running flutter run or clicking the Run button in Xcode.



### Common Bugs on a Physical Device
 1. Device not Found ❌

- Go to the Terminal type Command "Flutter Devices"
- This Verifies Whether Flutter recognise your Connected device
- Disable USB Debugging and Turn it on again

2. Android SDK not Configured  ❌

- Go to Android Studio -> Settings  
- Search for Android SDK and Copy the Location Path
- Go Back to the Terminal and type flutter config --android-sdk and then copy your Path ahead of it

3. Android Licenses  Status Unknown   ❌

- Go to Terminal run Command flutter doctor --android-licenses
- Accept (y/n) : Y to accept Licenses
