## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

- Successful communication requires the efforts of all people involved
The education industry is being digitized through smart devices and technology is addictive and fascinating. 
- Reading books is really boring but with the help of AR, we can help turn it into a fun experience.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>
We are trying to create an application/web-based solution following its
incorporated features: 
- Vritaant is a cross-platform application to help the naughty and carefree young ones learn and understand nursery rhymes in a fun and interactive way.
- Vritaant helps to incorporate Augmented Reality  based digital learning experiences to help children take their first step into formal education
- Visualisation of nursery rhymes by putting them in a real 3D environment with in-space
navigation support.
- 3D models for the rhyme characters are  supporting and connecting blocks to create a setting and putting it in the real world.
- Augmented Reality powered voice-based support aims at helping kids aged 3-4 to learn nursery rhymes at a faster pace.
- Support for playground features makes it easier to test out various 3D models that are accessible, perform various transformations, and render numerous instances.
- The application is made more secure by leveraging Google authentication through Firebase.
