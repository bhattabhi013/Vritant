<h3 align="center">Workflow of the Project</h3>

📌 We have firstly identify the need of children like their problems in studying <br>
📌 First of all when user will get to our app ,there will be Google authentication for login. <br>
📌 User can login by their mail as it is easy to do <br>
📌 Google authentication is very secured to use <br>
📌 We have many rhymes for vast variety of choice <br>
📌 One can read the text and also play with it using text-to-speech functionality, as for kids reading one is hard so they can listen to the text as well <br>
📌 We have feature of 3-D models present for rhymes which will make understanding more good by visualising it live <br>
📌 A section Playground is also present in that user can experience AR in real life which leads to more clearity of rhymes <br>
📌 User can create many senses of 3-D models and they can rotate it and play with it <br>
📌 We have made this application like if user want to move the model they can as it gets automatic aligned <br>
📌 User can alseo zoom in and zoom out the models <br>

<h3 align="center">Aim of the Project</h3>

📌 Learning is easy and fun by Vritant <br>
📌 Many features are there for best understanding of rhymes <br>
📌 Vritant is purely made by new and unique ideas <br> 
📌 We have made it in such a way that kids will not be bored while learning <br>
📌 Vritant is easily accesible to all <br>
📌 There is no need to pay money as the app is free <br>
📌 Vritant targets kids to learn in fun without any pressure <br>

## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

- Successful communication requires the efforts of all people involved
Education industry is being digitized through smart devices technology being addictive and fascinating. 
- Reading books is really boring but with the help of AR we can help turn it into a fun experience.

## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>
We are trying to create an application/web-based solution following its
incorporated features: 
- Vritaant is a cross-platform application to help the naughty and carefree young ones learn and understand nursery rhymes in a fun and interactive way.
- Vritaant helps to incorporate Augmented Reality  based digital learning experience to help children take their first step into formal education
- Visualisation of nursery rhymes by putting them in a real 3D environment with in-space
navigation support.
- 3D models for the rhyme characters are  supporting and connecting blocks to create a setting and putting it in real world.
- Augmented Reality powered voice - based support aims at helping kids age 3-4 to learn the nursery rhymes at a faster pace.
- Support for playground features makes it easier to test out various 3D models that are accessible, perform various transformations, and render numerous instances.
- The application is made more secure by leveraging Google authentication through Firebase.

## 🚀 Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>
- We will provide the option to create a 3D model of any image that the user scans in addition to the Playground feature's current functionality.
- Speech-reading to aid
communication within a
group.
- Increasing a wide variety of tracks to choose from like learning alphabets or numbers to fun rhymes, colors and shapes to keep the child engaged.
